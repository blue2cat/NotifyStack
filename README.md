## What is NotifyStack? 
NotifyStack is a simple notification broker. It allows users to send notifications in various formats to a central broker, which then forwards the notifications to the appropriate output adapters (SMTP, Webhook, logfile, etc). This allows for a single point of configuration for all notifications, and allows for easy integration with existing systems. 

A future goal of this project is to provide a simple web interface for configuring notification routing. 
## What's the current status of NotifyStack?
