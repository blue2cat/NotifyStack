# NotifyStack
WARNING: This project is in early development and is not yet ready for production use.

NotifyStack is a simple notification broker. It allows users to send notifications in various formats to a central broker, which then forwards the notifications to the appropriate output adapters (SMTP, Webhook, logfile, etc). This allows for a single point of configuration for all notifications, and allows for easy integration with existing systems. 

A future goal of this project is to provide a simple web interface for configuring notification routing. 

## Installation
NotifyStack is built on Docker and Docker Compose. Further instructions will be provided once the project is more mature.
